Simplon/Facebook

-------------------------------------------------

## 1. Intro

This library helps you to communicate with ```Facebook's graph API```. It's goal is to get you quickly started by solving common use issues which unfortunately occur quite often within Facebook's graph API. 

-------------------------------------------------

## 2. Requirements

You will need a registered ```Facebook app``` in order to communicate with the API. Apps can be registered at [Facebooks Developers Portal](https://developers.facebook.com/). Simply have a look at ```My Apps``` and click ```Add a new app```.   

-------------------------------------------------

## 3. Install

Easy install via composer. Still no idea what composer is? Inform yourself [here](http://getcomposer.org).

```json
{
  "require": {
    "simplon/facebook": "*"
  }
}
```

-------------------------------------------------

## 4. User

The following paragraphs demonstrate how to authenticate a user against your facebook app. It will also show how to ```read an access token```, receive a ```long term access token``` and to ```retrieve a user's data```.

### 4.1. Request access token

We need a url to which we will redirect the user in order to authenticate our app with the requested permissions.
You will need a callback url for this. Facebook will redirect the user after handling the authentication process. This includes a cancellation as well.

For our little example we will go with the default permissions of ```public_profile```. Permissions depend on what you would like to do on behalf of the user.
[Here is a list](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions#reference) of all possible permissions. 

```php
$appId = 'YOUR-APPID';
$appSecret = 'YOUR-APPSECRET';

// get a facebook app instance
$app = new FacebookApps($appId, $appSecret);

// we need a user instance
$user = new FacebookUsers($app, new FacebookPosts());

// callback url
$urlCallback = 'https://your-domain.com/callback/';

// we will fly with the default permissions: public_profile
$permissions = [];

// now lets build the url
$user->getUrlAuthentication($urlCallback, $permissions); // https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=...

// redirect user to the given url...
```

After the user went through the authentication on Facebook's he/she will be redirected to your ```callback url```. If the user cancelled the process you will receive the following ```GET request```:

```
YOUR_CALLBACK_URL?
  error_reason=user_denied
  &error=access_denied
  &error_description=The+user+denied+your+request.
```

Otherwise you will receive an authentication code through the following ```GET request```:

```
YOUR_CALLBACK_URL?
  code=AQBggnsv...
```

To finally receive an ```access token``` in order to work with it we need to use the given ```code``` and our pre-defined ```callback url```:

```php
$appId = 'YOUR-APPID';
$appSecret = 'YOUR-APPSECRET';

// get a facebook app instance
$app = new FacebookApps($appId, $appSecret);

// we need a user instance
$user = new FacebookUsers($app, new FacebookPosts());

$code = 'AQBggnsv...'; // received code
$urlCallback = 'https://your-domain.com/callback/'; // this needs to be the exact same url as before

// request access token
$user->requestAccessTokenByCode($code, $urlCallback)

// print token
echo $user->getAccessToken(); // CAANc8o7bTTcBAPyTZCwW....
```

If you did not receive any ```FacebookException``` you should hold now a ```user's access token```.
You need to save the ```access token``` so that you can make use of it.

__This token has usally a lifetime of 1 to 2 hours.__ Read on to see how to request a ```long term access token```.

### 4.2. Access token information

Wanna see what data are attached to an access token? Do the following:

```php
$appId = 'YOUR-APPID';
$appSecret = 'YOUR-APPSECRET';

// your saved access token
$userAccessToken = 'CAANc8o7bTTcBAPyTZCwW....';

// get a facebook app instance
$app = new FacebookApps($appId, $appSecret);

// we need an app access token for this
$app->requestAccessToken();

// now we can have a look at the attached data for the user access token
$debugTokenVo = $app->getDebugTokenVo($userAccessToken); // have a look at the class DebugTokenData

// is this a short term token?
$debugTokenVo->isShortTermToken(); // bool
```

### 4.3. Request a long term access token

Lets assume we received a token and by having a look at its attached data we figured that its a ```short term token```.
Turn this token into a ```60 days long term token```. When you received the new token make sure that you save it for later use.

```php
$appId = 'YOUR-APPID';
$appSecret = 'YOUR-APPSECRET';

// your saved access token
$userAccessToken = 'CAANc8o7bTTcBAPyTZCwW....';

// get a facebook app instance
$app = new FacebookApps($appId, $appSecret);

// we need a user instance
$user = new FacebookUsers($app, new FacebookPosts());

// request long term token
$user->setAccessToken($userAccessToken)->requestLongTermAccessToken();

// your new token
$user->getAccessToken(); // save the new token away
```

There won't be any harm done if you have already a ```long term token```.

### 4.4. Request user data

Alright, now that we have an access token we can do some requests - depending which [permissions you requested](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions#reference).
In our case we have the default permission of ```public_profile```. The following example will request a user's data:

```php
$appId = 'YOUR-APPID';
$appSecret = 'YOUR-APPSECRET';

// your saved access token
$userAccessToken = 'CAANc8o7bTTcBAPyTZCwW....';

// get a facebook app instance
$app = new FacebookApps($appId, $appSecret);

// we need a user instance
$user = new FacebookUsers($app, new FacebookPosts());

// fetch user data
$facebookUserDataVo = $user->setAccessToken($userAccessToken)->getUserData(); // the class holds all data

// lets print the name
$facebookUserDataVo->getFullName(); // Foo Bar
```
